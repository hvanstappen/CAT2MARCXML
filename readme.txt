Convert CATXML to MARCXML This is a XML stylesheet which can convert library records in propietary CATXML (from the Brocade library management system) to MARCXML. It was developed for a specific instance form Brocade, so not all elements from the CATXML namespace may be included (yet). 

The DTD for the CATXML can be found at http://webi.provant.be/brocade/catalog/catxml.dtd. Note that the definitions in this DTD are not entirely equal to the CATXML file for which this stylesheet was made.


There's no stylesheet for the authorities either.
